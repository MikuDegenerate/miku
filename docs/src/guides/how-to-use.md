# How to use it

Once you have it running [locally](/guides/run-local) or [on the cloud](/guides/run-cloud), you can use it to chat with your bot.

First you will need to select one of the available bots.

After selecting a bot, you can start chatting with it.

* Set "Dialog" to send conversation messages. You can also do actions with asterisks; for example `*pats her in the head*`
* Set "Context" to indicate an environment change. For example, if you want to role-play going to the beach with your bot, write `They go to the beach`.
* The "credits" amount is a feature for development purposes. It's just there to show the estimated cost of the current interaction. It's not used for anything else.

### Save and load chat history

The bot conversation is not stored in any server. You need to save it locally if you want to keep it. You can also load a saved conversation. The conversation history is a JSON file that you need store in your computer.
